# Single-Cycle MIPS Processor Simulation in SystemVerilog
# Project Overview:
This project simulates a single-cycle MIPS processor using SystemVerilog. The processor is designed to execute instructions in a single clock cycle, and key components such as the Program Counter, Instruction Memory, Data Memory, ALU, Control Unit, and Register File are implemented and simulated.

# Documentation:
1. Provides detailed documentation describing the design and functionality of each component.
2. Includes waveform simulations to demonstrate processor operation.

# Deliverables:
1. SystemVerilog source code for the single-cycle MIPS processor.
2. Testbench code for comprehensive testing.
3. Simulation results and waveform diagrams.

# How to Use:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the SystemVerilog files in a compatible simulation environment.
3. Run the simulation to observe the processor's behavior.
4. Refer to the documentation for further details on design and testing.
